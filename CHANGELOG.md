## [Unreleased]

### Added — handoff bridge, KB grounding, persistence (2026-06-19)

- **Sunshine Conversations bridge** for inline human-agent handoff. `SunshineConversationsAdapter` (httpx, v2 REST) opens a conversation per session and posts the AI summary + recent transcript as a business message; `forward_customer_message` relays subsequent customer turns. Reuses the existing `ZENDESK_KEY_ID` / `ZENDESK_SECRET_KEY` for HTTP Basic auth.
- **`HandoffBridge`** coordinator with per-session `asyncio.Queue` subscribers and a pluggable `HandoffStorePort` backing.
- **`GET /chat/stream/{session_id}`** — Server-Sent Events stream that yields `agent_message` events with a 30 s heartbeat.
- **`POST /webhooks/sunshine`** — HMAC-SHA256-verified webhook handler. Customer-authored events are dropped (we already showed them in the UI when the user pressed Send); business-authored events are published to the matching session's queue.
- **Frontend `ChatMessage.role` extended with `'agent'`** + purple-tinted card styling. `chat.store` opens an `EventSource` on handoff when `live_chat_available` is true, appends incoming agent messages to the same log, and closes the stream on `resetSession`.
- **`HandoffStatePort`** — persistence boundary for the bridge. Two implementations: `InMemoryHandoffStore` (dev/tests) and `FirestoreHandoffStore` (one doc per active handoff in `proton-db/handoff_sessions/<session_id>` with indexed reverse-lookup). The bridge keeps a read-through in-process cache; a backend restart costs one Firestore round-trip per session before warm.
- **`KNOWLEDGE_PROVIDER=vertex_search` path** — `VertexAISearchAdapter` queries the `proton-kb-engine` Discovery Engine over the `proton-kb` data store and reads `struct_data` (our authoritative fields) ahead of `derived_struct_data`. Falls back to the pre-extracted `body_excerpt` for content because Standard tier doesn't return snippets.
- **`scripts/scrape_proton.py` rewritten as a structured KB pipeline** — produces JSONL Documents (one per line) with `{id, struct_data: {title, link, language, body_excerpt, sections}, content: {uri, mime_type}}` from the Proton website sitemap, uploads JSONL + HTML to GCS, creates the data store + engine if missing, and imports with `data_schema="document"`. Discrete CLI stages (`--scrape-only`, `--upload-only`, `--import-only`, `--purge`).
- **Agent prompt** rewritten as a three-step playbook (Search → Answer → optionally Escalate). Explicit `NO_MATCHES` branching, Markdown-link citations from `Source URL`, replies in the customer's language (en / ms / zh). Grounds the agent in Proton's product domain.
- **Settings** — `SUNSHINE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `HANDOFF_STORE`, `FIRESTORE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIRESTORE_DATABASE_ID`, `FIRESTORE_HANDOFF_COLLECTION`, `KNOWLEDGE_PROVIDER`, `VERTEX_SEARCH_*`.
- **ADR-0003** — coupled decision for the Sunshine Conversations bridge, Vertex AI Search KB, and Firestore handoff persistence.

### Changed — handoff & KB (2026-06-19)

- **BREAKING — handoff UX is no longer the Zendesk Messenger widget.** `<script id="ze-snippet">`, `zESettings`, `plugins/zendesk.ts`, and the `HandoffStatus.vue` full-panel swap are removed. Handoff now keeps the existing chat log + input visible and renders agent replies inline as a new `'agent'` message role. Deployments that depended on the embedded widget must switch to registering a Sunshine Conversations webhook integration pointing at `POST /webhooks/sunshine`.
- **BREAKING — `ChatTurnResponse` adds `forwarded_to_agent: bool`** and `HandoffPayload` adds `live_chat_available: bool`. The voice `X-Handoff-*` headers gain `X-Handoff-Live-Chat`.
- **`OrchestratorService` constructor** takes new optional `human_agent_bridge: HumanAgentBridgePort | None` and `handoff_bridge: HandoffBridge | None` parameters. When both are present and the session is already handed off, `/chat/turn` text is forwarded to Sunshine Conversations instead of Gemini.
- **Zendesk Support tickets** are now attributed to a session-scoped pseudo-user (`Proton AI Customer (<session-id>)` with email `<session-id>@proton.devoteam.example`) instead of defaulting to the API token owner. Stops escalation emails from landing in the admin's inbox.
- **`InMemoryKnowledgeAdapter`** is now a development fallback only — the production path is `KNOWLEDGE_PROVIDER=vertex_search`.
- **Agent tool set** — `classify_ticket_tool` is dropped from the registered tools because its result was stored only in `tool_context.state` (unread downstream) and Gemini was treating the classify call as the turn's terminal action, silently skipping the customer-facing text reply. The function stays defined so it can be re-enabled once its state is wired into the handoff payload.

### Fixed — handoff & KB (2026-06-19)

- **Empty replies on grounded questions.** Root cause: Gemini 2.5 Flash treating `classify_ticket_tool` as the terminal call. Fixed by dropping the tool from the registered set.
- **GCS object URI surfaced to the customer as the citation link.** Vertex's `derived_struct_data.link` overrides our canonical Proton URL with the bucket URI. Adapter now prefers our explicit `struct_data` before falling back to derived.
- **Two-ticket fragmentation on handoff.** The Zendesk Support ticket (with AI transcript) and the Messenger conversation (live chat) are still distinct records, but now share a `session-<id>` tag and external_id linkage so agents can correlate. The user-facing UI no longer shows two chat surfaces.
- **Handoff state lost on backend restart.** `HandoffBridge`'s `session_id ↔ conversation_id` map is now persisted in Firestore (`HANDOFF_STORE=firestore`). Subscribers (SSE queues) are still in-process; clients reconnect after a restart.
- **Sunshine webhook signature verification rejected all real v2 traffic.** `verify_webhook_signature` only computed an HMAC-SHA256 of the body and compared it to `X-Api-Key`, but Sunshine Conversations v2 sends the **raw shared secret** directly in `X-Api-Key` — so every genuine webhook would have returned `401`. The check now accepts the request when `X-Api-Key` matches the shared secret (constant-time) **or** an HMAC-SHA256 of the body (legacy Smooch v1 back-compat); both still require knowledge of the secret. Added `adapters/test_sunshine_conversations.py` covering both accept paths plus rejection.

### Added
- **Monorepo structure** (`apps/backend/` + `apps/frontend/`) per `project-structure-vue-frontend.md`.
- **Vue 3 frontend** at `apps/frontend/` (Vite + TypeScript + Pinia, `<script setup lang="ts">` exclusively). Vertical feature slices for `chat/` and `voice/`, each with its own `api/`, `store/`, `components/`, and `types/`.
- **`useVoiceCapture` composable** — `getUserMedia` + `AnalyserNode` + `MediaRecorder` with built-in **voice activity detection** (sustained-silence auto-stop, configurable RMS floor / min-speech / trailing-silence). On stop, the captured Opus blob is decoded via `AudioContext.decodeAudioData`, mixed to mono, linearly resampled to 16 kHz, and packed as 16-bit PCM WAV — Gemini accepts WAV natively, so Chrome's webm/opus output is no longer rejected.
- **`WaveformDisplay.vue`** — 48-bar canvas waveform driven by the live analyser; switches palette when speech is detected.
- **`VoiceRecorder.vue`** rewritten as **tap-to-talk** with a four-phase status machine (`idle → listening → processing → speaking`), pulsing halo locked to mic level, mid-turn manual-stop, and a <kbd>Space</kbd>-key shortcut.
- **`phase` state in `useVoiceStore`** — `'idle' | 'listening' | 'processing' | 'speaking'`. Assistant audio autoplays and flips back to `idle` on `ended`.
- **`POST /chat/turn`** — JSON in, JSON out frontend chat endpoint (returns `{reply, language, sentiment, handoff}`).
- **`POST /voice/turn`** — multipart audio in (now `audio/wav`), `audio/mpeg` out with `X-Reply-Text` (URL-encoded) and `X-Handoff-Reason` response headers.
- **CORS middleware** on the backend; new `FRONTEND_ORIGINS` setting accepts a JSON list of allowed origins and defaults to Vite's port fallbacks (`5173`–`5180`).
- **Vertex AI env mirroring** — `bootstrap_application` now copies `vertex_project_id` / `vertex_location` into `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` / `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` so the `google-genai` SDK actually sees them when `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true`. A single `.env` now drives both layers.
- **`GEMINI_TTS_MODEL` / `GEMINI_TTS_VOICE`** settings selecting the Gemini TTS model and voice (defaults: `gemini-2.5-flash-tts`, `Kore`).
- **ADR 0002** documenting the monorepo, Vue frontend, and Gemini end-to-end audio decisions together.

### Changed
- **BREAKING — voice pipeline rewritten end-to-end through Gemini.**
  - `OrchestratorService.handle_voice_turn` now sends the audio bytes directly as a multimodal `Part` to the ADK runner. No separate transcription step.
  - `GcpTextToSpeechAdapter` replaced by `GeminiTextToSpeechAdapter` — uses Cloud TTS with `model_name="gemini-2.5-flash-tts"`.
  - `MockVoiceAdapter` now implements only `TextToSpeechPort`.
- **Frontend upload format**: voice turns now post `audio/wav` (16 kHz mono PCM-16) instead of `audio/ogg`/`audio/webm`. The wire MIME is consumed verbatim by the ADK `Part`.
- **Settings — `frontend_origin: str` → `frontend_origins: list[str]`** (BREAKING for anyone overriding `.env`). `.env.example` updated; old `FRONTEND_ORIGIN=…` keys must be migrated to `FRONTEND_ORIGINS=["…"]`.
- **CORS consolidated to one middleware** in `bootstrap_application` (the duplicate `allow_origins=["*"]` in `create_app` was removed). Stacking two `CORSMiddleware` layers caused the restrictive one to win for preflight while the permissive one shaped simple-request responses — symptoms were "Failed to fetch" on `/chat/turn` from Vite fallback ports.
- **Frontend replaces the old `/sim` simulator.** The inline-HTML `features/sim/` package was deleted; the Vue app at `apps/frontend/` is the new UI surface.
- **CLAUDE.md, README, USAGE** updated for the new layout and `cd apps/backend` / `cd apps/frontend` workflow.

### Fixed
- **Chat "Failed to fetch" from Vite fallback ports** (e.g., `:5174`, `:5176`) — the old single-origin allowlist returned `400 Disallowed CORS origin` on preflight. Replaced with the multi-origin `FRONTEND_ORIGINS` list.
- **Voice `Maaf, terjadi kendala teknis…` fallback in Chrome** — Gemini does not accept `audio/webm;codecs=opus`, so every Chrome capture hit the exception handler. Re-encoding to WAV in the browser fixes the round trip natively.
- **`google-genai` not honouring Settings on Vertex** — declared but never propagated, so even with `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true` the SDK fell back to AI Studio (and 401'd without `GOOGLE_API_KEY`). Bootstrap now mirrors the values into the env vars the SDK actually reads.

### Removed
- **`useMediaRecorder` composable** — superseded by `useVoiceCapture` (which adds VAD + WAV encoding). Hold-to-talk semantics are gone; tap-to-talk replaces them.
- **Duplicate `CORSMiddleware`** registration in `chatbot/platform/server.py` (the permissive `allow_origins=["*"]` one).
- **BREAKING — Twilio integration removed entirely.**
  - Routes `/webhooks/voice/twilio` and `/webhooks/voice/twilio/process` deleted.
  - All TwiML generation and the `static/audio/` mount removed.
  - Settings `TWILIO_*`, `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, and `TWILIO_ESCALATION_PHONE` removed.
  - Deps `twilio`, `google-cloud-speech` and the `twilio.*` mypy override removed from `apps/backend/pyproject.toml`.
- `SpeechToTextPort` protocol and `VoiceTranscript` model deleted — Gemini consumes audio natively.
- `GcpSpeechToTextAdapter` deleted.

### Planned
- Safari support for the voice capture path (Safari's `MediaRecorder` is feature-limited; needs a polyfill or a WebAudio-only PCM capture path).
- Continuous "conversation mode" — auto-resume listening after the assistant finishes speaking.
- Frontend unit tests via Vitest (with the WAV encoder + VAD timing as first targets).
- Persistent session store (currently in-memory).
- Webhook signature verification on `/webhooks/zendesk` and `/webhooks/chatwoot`.
- Observability dashboards and alert wiring.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-18

Initial release. Single-app Python backend providing a unified conversational AI agent across text and voice channels with pluggable CRM/ticketing integration.

### Added

#### Agent core
- Google ADK integration over Gemini (`gemini-2.5-flash` default) in `features/chat/agents.py`.
- Tool-using support agent with three closures: `search_kb_tool`, `classify_ticket_tool`, `emit_handoff_tool`.
- Summarizer agent producing structured JSON handoff payloads on escalation.
- Escalation triggers: negative sentiment, keyword match, retry limit.

#### Platform layer (`src/chatbot/platform/`)
- `config.py` — Pydantic Settings loader for env + `.env` (typed, cached).
- `logger.py` — `structlog` JSON logging per `logging-and-observability-mandate.md`.
- `server.py` — FastAPI ASGI bootstrap with CORS and observability middleware.
- `main.py` — Dependency injection wiring; `GET /` health endpoint.

#### Feature slice (`src/chatbot/features/chat/`)
- `ports.py` — Protocols: `ChatPort`, `TicketingPort`, `KnowledgePort`, `SpeechToTextPort`, `TextToSpeechPort`.
- `models.py` — Immutable dataclasses (`Message`, `TurnResult`, `HandoffPayload`, `KbArticle`, `VoiceTranscript`).
- `service.py` — Conversation orchestrator with `handle_text_turn` and `handle_voice_turn`.
- `router.py` — Webhook endpoints:
  - `POST /webhooks/chatwoot`
  - `POST /webhooks/zendesk`
  - `POST /webhooks/voice/twilio` (welcome — returns TwiML)
  - `POST /webhooks/voice/twilio/process` (speech result — returns TwiML)
- `prompts.py`, `schemas.py` — model instruction templates and structured-output schemas.

#### Adapters (`features/chat/adapters/`)
- `mock.py` — In-memory `InMemoryChatAdapter`, `InMemoryTicketingAdapter`, knowledge and voice mocks. Enables zero-dependency unit tests.
- `chatwoot_zammad.py` — Async `httpx` client for Chatwoot Messaging + Zammad Ticketing.
- `zendesk.py` — Async client covering Sunshine Conversations (chat), Support API (ticketing), and Guide (knowledge base).
- `gcp_voice.py` — `GcpSpeechToTextAdapter` + `GcpTextToSpeechAdapter` using Google Cloud client libraries with Application Default Credentials.

#### Testing
- 9 tests across `test_service.py` (text + voice turn logic, pause/takeover, escalation) and `test_router.py` (webhook ingestion, Twilio TwiML generation).
- Strict `mypy --strict` passes on 18 source files.
- `ruff` passes (rules: `E F I B UP SIM RET ARG PL RUF ASYNC S C4`).

#### Tooling & configuration
- `pyproject.toml` — `hatchling` build backend, dev deps (`pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `ruff`, `mypy`), strict `mypy` config, `ruff` selections, `pytest` asyncio auto-mode.
- `uv.lock` — reproducible dependency lockfile.
- `.env.example` — env template covering provider, GCP, Zendesk, Chatwoot, and Zammad keys.
- `.gitignore` — excludes `.env`, virtualenv, lint/test caches, agent worktrees, local Claude settings.

#### Documentation
- `README.md` — project overview, quick-start, endpoint table, configuration reference.
- `docs/decisions/0001-python-fastapi-gemini-adk-stack.md` — first ADR recording the stack choice with options and consequences.
- `CLAUDE.md` — directory map and dev commands for AI-assisted contribution.
- `.agents/` — operations framework (15 personas, ~40 rules, ~50 skills, workflows).

### Changed
- `ZENDESK_EMAIL` promoted from a `getattr(settings, "zendesk_email", "admin@example.com")` fallback in `zendesk.py` to a first-class `Settings` field. The previous fallback would have silently authenticated against the wrong identity in production.

### Security
- `.env` is git-ignored from the first commit; only `.env.example` (placeholder values) is tracked.
- All third-party SDK calls use async clients (`httpx`, `google-cloud-*` async variants where available) to keep the ASGI loop unblocked under load.
